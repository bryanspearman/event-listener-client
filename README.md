# Event Listener [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bryanspearman/event-listener-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bryanspearman/event-listener-client)

Event Listener lets you count down to upcoming events or see how long its been since a past event. <br>

## Motivation:

I love countdown apps but I didn't want to create a native app. I wanted a web app. Plus none of the native apps seem to automatically change a future event to a past event when it's date arrives. So I built this one to do exactly that.
